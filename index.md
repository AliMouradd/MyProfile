Well I am Ali Mourad! My photo should be here somewhere, probably to the right of this text.<br />



I am currently a Computer Science student as California State University, Long Beach.

Here are some of languages I know:               
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>C#</li>
</ul>

## Current Research

**Block Chain**   <br>
Block chains are blocks of data interconnected to each other. The data each block carries depends on the type of
block chain. The most popular is a crpyto block chain where the data stored is ussually sender, reciever and amount
of coins being sent. A block also contains a hash value, which can be thought of a finger print for that block, and the
hash code for the previous block. This combined with a proof-of-work algorithm allows block chains to be secure through peer
to peer consensus.

**Usefulness and Proposal**   <br>
Blockchains are a powerful tool with huge potential. With a blockchain we can use it to track events on a supply chain.
This allows for full trusted transperancy at all levels of an enterprise. Consumers as well will be able to track where
there products are within the supply chain. Pair this up with elastic search and a well thought out machine learning algorithm
and you have a system which will be able to notify users when a product will need to be replaced in the future with minimal
search time.
